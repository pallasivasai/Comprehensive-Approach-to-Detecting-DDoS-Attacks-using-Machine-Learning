### **Comprehensive Approach to Detecting DDoS Attacks using Machine Learning**  

![DDoS Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/DDoS%20Detection-Machine%20Learning-blue)  

## 📌 **Project Overview**  
This project aims to detect **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks** using **Machine Learning** techniques. By analyzing network traffic patterns, the model classifies legitimate and malicious requests, helping in real-time threat mitigation.  

## 🚀 **Features**  
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to visualize traffic patterns  
- 🔍 **Feature Engineering** to extract critical attributes from network data  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Models** including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM  
- 🎯 **Performance Evaluation** using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- ⚡ **Real-time Detection Capability** for proactive defense against DDoS attacks  

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Preprocessing)  
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning Models)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
